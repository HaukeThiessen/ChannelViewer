# ChannelViewer
 Small tool to quickly display separate color channels of the screen. Useful when creating textures or editing vertex colors which contain different information in each channel and you don't have the option to view the channels separately in your software. Max, Maya and Unreal, for example don't support this function for vertex colors.
